# list:- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# tuple:- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# set:- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# dict:- Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable, and indexed. No duplicate members.  
# str:- String is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# bool:- Boolean is a data type that can only have two values: True or False.
# int:- Integer is a data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal points.
# float:- Float is a data type that represents real numbers, allowing for decimal points.
# complex:- Complex is a data type that represents complex numbers, which have a real and an imaginary part.
# None:- None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.
# bytes:- Bytes is a data type that represents immutable sequences of bytes, often used for binary data.
# bytearray:- Bytearray is a mutable sequence of bytes, allowing for modification of the byte data.
# frozenset:- Frozenset is an immutable version of a set, meaning it cannot be changed after creation.
# range:- Range is a built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.
# memoryview:- Memoryview is a built-in function that allows direct access to the memory of an object without copying it.
# Example of each data type in Python:-

# list = list in python will always be defined by []. JavaScript's array is equivalent to python's list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
len(my_list)  # Output: 5   

# tuple = tuple in python will always be defined by (). JavaScript's array is equivalent to python's tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
len(my_tuple)  # Output: 5  


# set = set in python will always be defined by {}. JavaScript's Set is equivalent to python's set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
len(my_set)  # Output: 5

# dict = dict in python will always be defined by {}. JavaScript's Object is equivalent to python's dict
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
len(my_dict)  # Output: 3


# str = str in python will always be defined by "". JavaScript's String is equivalent to python's str
my_str = "Hello, Harsh!"
print(my_str)  # Output: Hello, World!
len(my_str)  # Output: 13
