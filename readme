# Python Chai Learning

This repository contains my first Python programs as I learn the language. The code demonstrates basic Python concepts such as importing modules, defining functions, and printing output.

## Files

- [chai.py](f:/Python/chai.py): Imports the `chai` function from [`Hello_chai.py`](f:/Python/Hello_chai.py) and calls it with `"Ginger tea"`.
- [Hello_chai.py](f:/Python/Hello_chai.py): Prints a welcome message, defines the `chai` function, and calls it with `"lemom tea"`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python chai.py
   ```

## Output

When you run `chai.py`, you will see:
```
Chai aur python
lemom tea
Ginger tea
```

## Purpose

This project is for learning and practicing basic Python programming concepts.
